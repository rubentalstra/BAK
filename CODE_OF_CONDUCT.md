# BAK - Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of the **BAK** project, pledge to
create a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone. This
means we commit to fostering a community where all individuals, regardless of
experience level, gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, physical or
cognitive abilities, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status, feel welcome
and empowered to contribute.

## Our Standards

We expect all participants in the **BAK** community to uphold the following
standards of conduct:

- **Be Respectful**: Always be considerate and respectful in speech and actions.
  Critique code and ideas, not people.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide thoughtful and constructive feedback. When
  discussing alternatives, strive to be empathetic and understanding.
- **Avoid Harassment**: Refrain from any discriminatory, derogatory, or
  inappropriate behavior and language.
- **Inclusive Language**: Use inclusive language that welcomes diverse
  perspectives and does not assume backgrounds or experiences.
- **Collaboration**: Be supportive of new contributors and collaborate with
  other community members in a respectful manner. Offer help when you can, and
  be mindful when receiving assistance.
- **Professionalism**: Maintain a professional tone in all project spaces,
  including the repository, issues, and pull requests.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We will not tolerate behavior that violates the following:

- **Harassment**: Including, but not limited to, offensive comments related to
  personal characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, race, religion,
  disability, or other marginalized attributes.
- **Trolling**: Deliberate disruption of discussions, rude or dismissive
  behavior, and derailing threads.
- **Disrespect**: Personal attacks, insults, or unconstructive criticism.
- **Invasion of Privacy**: Publishing private information (doxing) without
  permission.
- **Exclusionary Behavior**: Deliberate exclusion of people from discussions or
  contributions based on personal characteristics.

## Enforcement

Community members who violate the Code of Conduct may be warned, muted, or
banned at the discretion of the project maintainers.

If you witness or experience any unacceptable behavior, please report it to the
